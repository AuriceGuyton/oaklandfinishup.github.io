Liz Walls has a passion for the outdoors.  Her educational and career focus has been around renewable & sustainable energy and specifically wind resources.  More specifically, on assessing and optimizing wind resource usage.

As a problem-solver who sees things through to completion, it was a natural for Liz to co-found Cancalia, where she leads from the trenches as the company's lead engineer.
